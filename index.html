                <p>Hello, this is a demo of what I see as a simple solution for a widget on a web page. The JavaScript file associated makes a call to a web service and HTML is returned. The HTML is rendered and added to a web page.</p>
                <p>An enterprise app may not work exactly like this, but a very similar interface is what I would see as a solution that would provide what the customer can implement. All of your logic will happen on the server side, not the client side. Some attributes can be saved to the client side, such as session token. This example does not provide that level of detail.</p>
